JUnit-QuickCheck Example
===

Small code kata (prime factors kata) I've used to play with [JUnit-QuickCheck](https://github.com/pholser/junit-quickcheck) plugin. The most interesting part is a history of commits that contains some interesting insights. 

You could find description and some comments (in Russian) [here](http://habrahabr.ru/post/240811/). Please let me know if you need some more info about this example.
